This website (version 2) exists to showcase some of my projects and also do some experimentation with the Gatsby React Framework. I've always wanted to try the framework since I noticed a lot of the sites that used it had this cool blur loading image loading effect. It also has GraphQL built into it. 

The UI makes use of the popular Material UI library(MUI). I am using a different domain.
