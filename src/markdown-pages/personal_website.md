This website (version 2) exists to showcase some of my projects and also do some experimentation with the Gatsby React Framework. I've always wanted to try the framework since I noticed a lot of the sites that used it had this cool blur loading image loading effect. It also has GraphQL built into it. 

The UI makes use of the popular Material UI library(MUI). I don't know exactly why but I feel that the gatsby build times and live reloading is very slow compared to NextJs. I would assume it would be somewhat fast because of caching. Maybe the amount of images, and graphql? The build time seems to take at several minutes and the reload can take like 10 of second why I find to be annoying. It reminds me of the times back in college and I pulled all nighters when it took like up to an hour to compile FPGA code and load the RAM. I'd would simulate the waveforms at the same time to spot the errors. An absolute nightmare. 

I think Gatsby is interesting but I would prefer not to use it ever again.
