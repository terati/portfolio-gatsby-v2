A new year means a new years resolution. Obviously, I want to increase my fundamental coding skill level. I will try new frontend frameworks. specifically, I want to try svelte. I will increase my knowledge in backend knowledge. I'll probably heavily focus on the Spring Framework in Java and on Cloud Computing. I will continue to learn Rust. 

1) Launch quebite in mid-January. 

I want to achieve >50k MAU and continue to improve and learn from that concept. If it flops, aw well. I'll probably actually find a job lmao. But most important learn from the things that stick. 

2) Strive from move 18.84% to top 7.25% on Leetcode. Increase solved from >500 to >1500 problems with >800 coming from medium + hard. 

Doing leetcode doesn't really matter to be honest but I feel like doing the problems make me a much stronger programmer. I feel like my problem solving skills vastly increased. 

3) Contribute to the open source community. 

Learn good practices from larger codebases. 

4) Expand my knowledge into domains of machine learning, deep learning.
